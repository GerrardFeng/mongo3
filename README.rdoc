== Mongo3

  Rule your mongoDB clusters!
  A Sinatra based admin console for mongoDB
  
== DESCRIPTION:

  Mongo3 allows you to manage your mongoDB clusters using a web based admin console.
  The console provides for getting an overview of your mongo landscape and drilldown to
  see various information about your databases. You will be able to manage your clusters
  by performing common database admin tasks directly from the web console.
  
  The initial release of Mongo3 will be a read only shallow mode. Further development
  still needs to take place to build up the functionality from the existing code base.

== USAGE:
  
=== Configure It!

  You will need to give mongo3 some information about your mongo configuration. 
  In order to do so create a .mongo3 directory in your home directory and create 
  a file landscape.yml. You will need to specify the envs, host and ports specific
  to your configuration, but here is a sample.
  
  landscape.yml  
    development:
      host: localhost
      port: 27017
    
    beta:
      host:     beta_host_name
      port:     27017
      user:     bobo
      password: secret
    
=== Launch It!

    Launch it. Fires up sinatra and opens up the console
    NOTE: Assumes memcache server is running on local host with default port!
